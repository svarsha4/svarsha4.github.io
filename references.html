											Saul is a remarkable, dedicated, and ambitious student. He makes
											every class that I have had him in better by asking thoughtful,
											probing questions. He is sociable, inquisitive, and I've seen
											him excel both individually as well as working within a team.
											He's one of the most driven students I've seen in my career.
											In addition to being excellent academically, he is one of the most
											teachable students I've ever had the pleasure of having in class.
											I give him my highest recommendation.

											Saul interned with the Siemens Capital software aerospace business development 
                                            team in 2023 and 2024, helping us with gathering market data, and 
                                            developing tools for data analysis. I mentored and guided Saul as he worked 
                                            on a variety of assignments ranging from market data collection, documenting data 
                                            and process flow, developing data visualizations, and presenting the results of 
                                            his work. He displays a high degree of motivation and is good with reaching out 
                                            to others with questions or for follow up. He was very open to tackling new 
                                            assignments, and open to learning new skills. During the internship, he 
                                            learned how to use Tableau, MS Access, and vba coding to complete assignments 
                                            in a self-teaching approach.

											I worked with Saul in the 2021 Iowa State University Data Science 
                                            for the Public Good Young Scholars Program. 
                                            I was the graduate fellow supervising his work, as well as two other 
                                            undergraduate interns, on a project working with the central Iowa 
                                            non-profit Eat Greater Des Moines. Throughout the summer, Saul showed 
                                            great curiosity and a willingness to ask questions. He was ready to 
                                            take on challenges, learn new things, and get help when needed. Saul 
                                            approached our work with excitement to reach our goals. Our project 
                                            expanded his skillset in Python and introduced him to Google Data Studio 
                                            for data visualization. I fully expect him to continue to expand his data 
                                            science skills and grow as a data scientist. I think that Saul can be a 
                                            good addition to any team due to his willingness to ask questions and 
                                            enthusiasm for his work.
