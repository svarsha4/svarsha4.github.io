											<h1>About Saul</h1>
											<hr class="main-border-about">
										</header>
										<br>

										<p style="color: black; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 20px">
											Saul is a <b style="color: black; font-size: 17px">Magna Cum Laude</b> graduate of <b style="color: black; font-size: 17px">Drake University</b> with a B.S. in
											Computer Science, Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence.
											Throughout his time in college, he has gained valuable internship and research experience in
											addition to his coursework.
										</p>
										<p style="color: black; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px">
											During his first internship with a nonprofit, Saul's innovative work in Data Science
											earned him recognition from the <b style="color: black; font-size: 17px">American Statistical Association</b>
											for its significant impact on the food rescue process, helping combat hunger in local communities.
											At <b style="color: black; font-size: 17px">MidAmerican Energy</b>, Saul continued to apply his
											growing skillset in Data Science to identify which wind turbines were at risk of failure and needed
											to be shut down, reducing unnecessary costs by <b style="color: black; font-size: 17px">15%</b> - an
											example of his ability to deliver actionable insights that drive measurable outcomes.
										</p>
										<p style="color: black; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px">
											Saul has also expanded his skillset in Data Analytics more broadly, as well as in Software Development.
											He has developed dynamic dashboards, queried complex databases, trained machine learning models, etc.
											His experience training for and competing in the prestigious <b style="color: black; font-size: 17px">NCNA Regional Programming Contest</b>
											has further sharpened his problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills, all of which made him a more
											<b style="color: black; font-size: 17px">versatile</b> software developer and tech professional.
										</p>
										<p style="color: black; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px">
											Traveling back in time, Saul's passion for tech began in middle school, when he and his friends
											stumbled upon Scratch.mit.edu. They would frequently get together to design various games, animations, etc.,
											becoming addicted to the feeling of creating something that looks impossible at first glance.
										</p>
										<p style="color: black; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px">
											Outside of his career, Saul loves fitness â€“ but not the traditional "gym bro" training.
											From kettlebells to animal flow, he likes to witness and unlock his body's amazing capabilities.
											Saul also loves being out in nature, whether it's kayaking, rock climbing, going on a long hike, etc.
											However, Saul does have days when he wants to stay in with a good book, TV show, or board game.
